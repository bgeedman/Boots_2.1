    This will be the main loop when running in joystick mode. It currently only
    works on the command line mode, but when I decide to add the keyboard part,
    I will port it to the joystick as well. Also, there may be a better way of
    setting this up in a class as to make the event loop cleaner.

    Quick overview, the joystick trigger button engages stretch mode when pressed
    and when it is released exits stretch mode. Stretch mode is just a way to show
    off the Inverse Kinematics and really serves no other purpose.  Other buttons
    have no use either.

    To manuver the robot, just move the joystick in normal mode.  The pitch and roll
    axes are used to calculate a vector on which to walk.  The yaw axis is used to
    send the turn command.  To turn, you must be in neutral.
