/*
 * Defining a simple state machine for the differnt states robot can be in.
 * Each state function returns the next state that should be run and can return
 * itself to indicate a repeat.
 *
 * TODO: Need to figure out a way to do the state transitions. Maybe have
 * intermediate states that handle that and can't be interrupted until they
 * have finished running. For Example: When going from the STAND to the PARK
 * state, perhaps have a STAND_TO_PARK STATE
 *
 * STATE_TRANSITIONS:
 * ------------------
 * SETUP    -> CLEANUP, END
 * PARK     -> STAND, CLEANUP
 * STAND    -> PARK, STRETCH, TURN, WALK, CLEANUP
 * STRETCH  -> PARK, CLEANUP
 * WALK     -> PARK, CLEANUP
 * TURN     -> PARK, CLEANUP
 * CLEANUP  -> END
 * END      -> EXIT
